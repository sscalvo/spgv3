# spgv3
## This is the 3rd iteration over SPG project
The aim is (not in order/priority): 

- Use Github
- Try to minimize overlapping between REDIPS and SPG
- Optimize SPG code
- Use snake_case
- pin students
- Add mor redips.dropMode options (at least 'switch' and 'shift')
- Prepare ground for accepting Dhamma Hall maps/layouts (for special halls with columns, diamond shapes, etc)
- Prepare ground for compatibility with vray and dhammareg
